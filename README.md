# SimpleElementSystem !
My first libary where you can add a world, systems, and elements who work directly together !

My idea behind the libary was that you can with a few lines of code achieve results so im here with my 8 step system(actually i just did see you can have even less :))

First download the lib on --> https://github.com/Lovingsoul1337/SimpleElementSystem

second require the lib

third drop a system in the system folder

fourth drop a draw system in the drawing folder(premade)

fifth create a world in main

six create a entity in main

seven call world:update() in love.update() --dont forget to pass dt :)

eight call world:draw in love.draw()

see the magic happens :)

If you have questions or some ideas just ask me and i try answering it !

best regards

Michael

Disclamer:

Since this is my first lib dont expect too much its more for beginners that want see fast results and not for big projects !
ps. rectangle_ninja.png is self made you can use it everyhwere you want ! :ultraglee:
